  "input": "storywise is a software specialized in creating software specifications. It has many helpful features that make the work of requirement engineers and business analysts faster and easier - especially the recurring, manual tasks. Projects are usually started with the wizard. The text (usually from the customer) is copied into the wizard. The wizard then recognizes certain areas of the software (Epics) into which the specification could be divided. You can accept these suggestions or specify them manually. Then the original sentences are assigned to the Epics, making it traceable which original sentence belongs where. Since they are also assigned to User Stories, you can then easily see if certain requirements from the customer may have been overlooked. After that, the roles in the system are recognized and defined to help with the later creation of User Stories. The User Stories are finally created or simply reformulated Epic by Epic. When recommending User Stories, the system tries to suggest new User Stories from the entire visible context that might be missing or provide added value. You can accept these even if you identify them as something you don't want - you can also list them to indicate what you're not building, which can be very important information for both client and contractor. When reformulating, the system tries to rephrase the existing information into the form of a User Story. Once you've done these steps for all Epics, the wizard is finished - and you've already prepared a good part of the specification. An important function is the library. This library contains self-predefined Epics, Stories, and Tasks that you potentially need in multiple proposals. This library makes it faster to create proposals that have common elements. To add a new Epic, Story, or Task to the library, you only need one click in the respective screen, and the content is available to the whole team. The software storywise also has a view for \"User Story Mapping\": We call it Canvas. This is like a large, shared map of all your Epics, Stories, and Tasks, something reminiscent of a Kanban board, but fulfilling a completely different task - namely planning the entire functionality. By seeing the Epics at the top and the necessary Stories below, the effort becomes visually apparent very quickly. You can work on this surface simultaneously and immediately see changes from others. Canvas helps you sort your Stories by importance, visualize your software workload, and figure out how different Stories are connected to each other. It also allows you to quickly switch between Stories, add new ones, and add estimates to the created Stories with just a few clicks. When the specification is finished, the specification can be output through a freely definable Word template as desired. The level of detail can be freely chosen, e.g., you can build a template for a customer that only shows the total effort or the effort per Epic, and one that breaks down the effort down to the tasks. Once the customer has given the order, the specification can either be downloaded in structured form or synchronized directly into a Jira project - with all information being transferred, and the developers can start work immediately with much fewer queries.",
